# Code Analysis Progress

## High-Level Analysis

- Have gone through the coding files to understand what's happening, performing a high-level analysis of the code.
- Cross-checking if everything mentioned in the paper has been applied in the code.
- Had a meeting with Ahmed, and he asked me to go through the code first to develop an understanding, as it's non-producible due to a missing component.

## Missing Component

- The missing component is **interaction extraction**.

- Currently looking for the missing component in **KGAT** (link sent by Dr. Ashish).
